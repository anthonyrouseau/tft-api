# TFT API

## Description

This API is used with the [TFT Client](https://github.com/anthonyrouseau/tft-client) for a data visualization and analytics dashboard app for the game Teamfight Tactics created by Riot Games. Users can search for a Summoner and get info on their recent games. The dashboard also provides a visual representation of the users performance that can be filtered to provide insight into winning strategies.
